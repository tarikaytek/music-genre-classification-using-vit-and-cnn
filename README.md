Comparison of Vision Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks with different hyperparameters on the task of music genre classification

## Target
In this project, I built Vision Transformers and Convolutional Neural Network models from scratch, trained them on a musical data, and compared the results after. The main target was to see differences how Vision Transformer models would work on digital signal data and compare it to CNN which is classical in the field. Another most beneficial target was to gain hands-on experience on building ViT and CNN architectures from scratch.

## Dataset
We used GTZAN dataset for our task which is classical in the field of musical research with digital signal processing.
